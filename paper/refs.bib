                   follows the ordinary laws of hydrodynamics, the
                   motion being produced by gravity and the pressure
                   gradient force acting in the liquid. By making use of
                   Darcey's law, that flow is proportional to the forces
                   producing flow, the equation K2 +K +gK/z = sA /t may
                   be derived for the capillary conduction of liquids in
                   porous mediums. It is possible experimentally to
                   determine the capillary potential =dp/ , the
                   capillary conductivity K, which is defined by the
                   flow equation q=K(g ), and the capillary capacity A,
                   which is the rate of change of the liquid content of
                   the medium with respect to . These variables are
                   analogous, respectively, to the temperature, thermal
                   conductivity, and thermal capacity in the case of
                   heat flow. Data are presented and application of the
                   equations is made for the capillary conduction of
                   water through soil and clay but the mathematical
                   formulations and the experimental methods developed
                   may be used to express capillary flow for other
                   liquids and mediums. The possible existance of a
                   hysteresis effect between the capillary potential and
                   moisture content of a porous medium is considered.},

                   electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and
                   transmission radar tomography, can provide
                   high-resolution images of hydrogeological structures
                   and, in some cases, detailed assessment of dynamic
                   processes in the subsurface environment. Through
                   appropriate petrophysical relationships, these tools
                   offer data suitable for parameterising and
                   constraining models of groundwater flow. This is
                   demonstrated using cross-borehole radar and
                   resistivity measurements collected during a
                   controlled vadose zone tracer test, performed at a
                   field site in the UK Sherwood Sandstone. Both methods
                   show clearly the vertical migration of the tracer
                   over a 200h monitoring period. By comparing first and
                   second spatial moments of changes in moisture content
                   predicted from a numerical simulation of vadose zone
                   flow with equivalent statistics from two- and
                   three-dimensional ERT and cross-borehole radar
                   profiles the effective hydraulic conductivity is
                   estimated to be approximately 0.4m/d. Such a value is
                   comparable to field estimates from borehole hydraulic
                   tests carried out in the saturated zone at the field
                   site and provides valuable information that may be
                   utilised to parameterise pollutant transport models
                   of the site.},

                   Computational Fluid Dynamics tool box with a rising
                   adoption in both academia and industry due to its
                   continuously growing set of features and the lack of
                   license costs. Our previously developed discrete
                   adjoint version of OpenFOAM allows us to calculate
                   derivatives of arbitrary objectives with respect to a
                   potentially very large number of input parameters at
                   a relative (to a single primal flow simulation)
                   computational cost which is independent of that
                   number. Discrete adjoint OpenFOAM enables us to run
                   gradientbased methods such as topology optimization
                   efficiently. Up until recently only a serial version

                   and the amount of memory available for the solution

  abstract =      {Bayesian inverse modeling techniques are
                   computationally expensive because many forward
                   simulations are needed when sampling the posterior
                   distribution of the parameters. In this paper, we
                   combine the implicit sampling method and generalized
                   polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) to significantly
                   reduce the computational cost of performing Bayesian
                   inverse modeling. There are three steps in this
                   approach: (1) find the maximizer of the likelihood
                   function using deterministic approaches; (2)
                   construct a gPCE-based surrogate model using the
                   results from a limited number of forward simulations;
                   and (3) efficiently sample the posterior distribution
                   of the parameters using implicit sampling method. The
                   cost of constructing the gPCE-based surrogate model
                   is further decreased by using sparse Bayesian
                   learning to reduce the number of gPCE coefficients
                   that have to be determined. We demonstrate the
                   approach for a synthetic ponded infiltration
                   experiment simulated with TOUGH2. The surrogate model
                   is highly accurate with mean relative error that is
                   {\textless}0.035{\%} in predicting saturation and
                   {\textless}0.25{\%} in predicting the likelihood
                   function. The posterior distribution of the
                   parameters obtained using our proposed technique is
                   nearly indistinguishable from the results obtained
                   from either an implicit sampling method or a Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo method utilizing the full model.},

  abstract =      {In the geostatistical inverse problem of subsurface
                   hydrology, continuous hydraulic parameter fields, in
                   most cases hydraulic conductivity, are estimated from
                   measurements of dependent variables, such as
                   hydraulic heads, under the assumption that the
                   parameter fields are autocorrelated random space
                   functions. Upon discretization, the continuous fields
                   become large parameter vectors with (104−107)
                   elements. While cokriging-like inversion methods have
                   been shown to be efficient for highly resolved
                   parameter fields when the number of measurements is
                   small, they require the calculation of the
                   sensitivity of each measurement with respect to all
                   parameters, which may become prohibitive with large
                   sets of measured data such as those arising from
                   transient groundwater flow. We present a
                   Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method for the
                   geostatistical inverse problem, in which a single
                   adjoint equation needs to be solved to obtain the
                   gradient of the objective function. Using the
                   autocovariance matrix of the parameters as
                   preconditioning matrix, expensive multiplications
                   with its inverse can be avoided, and the number of
                   iterations is significantly reduced. We use a
                   randomized spectral decomposition of the posterior
                   covariance matrix of the parameters to perform a
                   linearized uncertainty quantification of the
                   parameter estimate. The feasibility of the method is
                   tested by virtual examples of head observations in
                   steady-state and transient groundwater flow. These
                   synthetic tests demonstrate that transient data can
                   reduce both parameter uncertainty and time spent
                   conducting experiments, while the presented methods
                   are able to handle the resulting large number of
                   measurements.},

                   information about the subsurface from geophysical
                   data. Geophysical inverse problems are inherently
                   multidisciplinary, requiring elements from the
                   relevant physics, numerical simulation, and
                   optimization, as well as knowledge of the geologic
                   setting, and a comprehension of the interplay between
                   all of these elements. The development and
                   advancement of inversion methodologies can be enabled
                   by a framework that supports experimentation, is
                   flexible and extensible, and allows the knowledge
                   generated to be captured and shared. The goal of this
                   paper is to propose a framework that supports many
                   different types of geophysical forward simulations
                   and deterministic inverse problems. Additionally, we
                   provide an open source implementation of this
                   framework in Python called SimPEG (Simulation and
                   Parameter Estimation in Geophysics,
                   http://simpeg.xyz). Included in SimPEG are staggered
                   grid, mimetic finite volume discretizations on a
                   number of structured and semi-structured meshes,
                   convex optimization programs, inversion routines,
                   model parameterizations, useful utility codes, and
                   interfaces to standard numerical solver packages. The
                   framework and implementation are modular, allowing
                   the user to explore, experiment with, and iterate
                   over a variety of approaches to the inverse problem.
                   SimPEG provides an extensible, documented, and
                   well-tested framework for inverting many types of
                   geophysical data and thereby helping to answer
                   questions in geoscience applications. Throughout the
                   paper we use a generic direct current resistivity
                   problem to illustrate the framework and functionality
                   of SimPEG.},

                   better and more efficient methods has grown as the
                   range of applications has increased. Mathematical
                   models involving evolutionary partial differential

                   relativity, earth sciences, and mathematical finance.
                   This textbook develops, analyzes, and applies
                   numerical methods for evolutionary, or
                   time-dependent, differential problems. Both PDEs and
                   ODEs are discussed from a unified viewpoint. The
                   author emphasizes finite difference and finite volume
                   methods, specifically their principled derivation,
                   stability, accuracy, efficient implementation, and
                   practical performance in various fields of science
                   and engineering. Smooth and nonsmooth solutions for
                   hyperbolic PDEs, parabolic-type PDEs, and initial
                   value ODEs are treated, and a practical introduction
                   to geometric integration methods is included as well.
                   Audience: suitable for researchers and graduate

  abstract =      {Scientific curiosity, exploration of georesources and
                   environmental concerns are pushing the geoscientific
                   research community toward subsurface investigations
                   of ever-increasing complexity. This review explores
                   various approaches to formulate and solve inverse
                   problems in ways that effectively integrate
                   geological concepts with geophysical and
                   hydrogeological data. Modern geostatistical
                   simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface
                   realizations that are in agreement with conceptual
                   geological models and statistical rock physics can be
                   used to map these realizations into physical
                   properties that are sensed by the geophysical or
                   hydrogeological data. The inverse problem consists of
                   finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface
                   realizations that are in agreement with the data. The
                   most general inversion frameworks are presently often
                   computationally intractable when applied to
                   large-scale problems and it is necessary to better
                   understand the implications of simplifying (1) the
                   conceptual geological model (e.g., using model
                   compression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g.,
                   using proxy models); and (3) the algorithm used to
                   solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte
                   Carlo or local optimization methods) to reach
                   practical and robust solutions given today's computer
                   resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need
                   to not only use geophysical and hydrogeological data
                   for parameter estimation purposes, but also to use
                   them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological
                   scenarios.},
