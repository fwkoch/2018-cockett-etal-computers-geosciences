  title: Efficient 3D inversions using the Richards equation
  description: Fluid flow in the vadose zone, governed by the Richards equation, requires characterizing hydraulic properties using direct and proxy measurements. We present an efficient inversion technique for 1D, 2D, and 3D hydraulic properties, implemented in SimPEG, enabling large-scale inversions with modest resources.
